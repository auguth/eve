A "Safe" Instruction Language for Execution on Von Neumann Architecture 

"No surprises, just safe choices"

**Features**
--------
- High Level - Pseudocode like (no crazy symbol usage - perfect for logicians)
- Inverse Syntax for Memory and Error Handling
- Automated Memory Management (without explicitly writing references and pointers)
- Automated Error Handling (Long Topic to Discuss.... but eliminates loopholes)
- Automated Disk Management (Types can be saved in files and can be queried, no need for specialized databases)
- Only Functions (still confused on what's running by a OOPs code)
- Command Based Instructions (Know what you write!, each statement is an instruction command)
- Indentation Based (or for Fun write serially, it will work too!)
- Strictly Typed Compiled (Why VMs and Interpreters if the CPU exists?)
- Types with Sign and Bounds (kindof like rustic types!)
- Immutable only Variables (Side Effects and Mutations Prevented)
- Immutability Offers Parallelization Analysis and Thread Safety
- No Float Mutation Operations (eve is precision based)
- No Loops, Use Recursions
and more..........

This language is created to ensure absolute stability, trustability, and performance. And also to write a new shift in kernel paradigm...

P.S: Not a beginner language though
